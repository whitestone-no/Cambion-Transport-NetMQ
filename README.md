# Cambion.Transport.NetMQ

Cambion is a lightweight distributed application framework with multiple and pluggable backends, providing a set of convenience functions for event handling.
If you have one application that needs to talk to another application, either on the same computer, or even on a different computer, you can't use the default
loopback backend provided with Cambion. This transport provider uses [NetMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/netmq) to send data between instances of Cambion.

## Installation

Cambion.Transport.NetMQ is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Whitestone.Cambion.Transport.NetMQ/) so you can install it in the NuGet Package Manager Console:

```
Install-Package Whitestone.Cambion.Transport.NetMQ
```

## Documentation

Documentation for the NetMQ transport is available on the [Cambion documentation site](https://cambion.readthedocs.io/en/latest)
